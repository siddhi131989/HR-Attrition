# HR-Attrition
This project is about the attrition analysis and prediction.
I have first performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the data using various libraries like numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib etc..

Then I have also used feature selection technique to select the features. The data is then oversampled using the SMOTE technique in order to deal with the imbalanced data.

Lastly I have trained many ML models from the scikit-learn library for prediction and compared the performance using Precision, Recall, Accuracy and F1 score metrics .
